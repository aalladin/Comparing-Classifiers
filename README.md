# Comparing-Classifiers

This document serves as a summary of how to compare and improve various machine learning classifiers. The goal is to evaluate the performance of logistic regression, KNN, decision tree, and SVM algorithms, and explore strategies for enhancing model performance.

Model Comparison
I've compared four different models using their default settings:

Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Tree
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
For each model, I aimed to assess its performance by recording the training time and evaluating the accuracy on both the training and test datasets.

Key Steps for Model Comparison:
Fit each model using the training data.
Record the training time for each model.
Evaluate each model's accuracy on both the training and test sets.
Model Improvement Strategies
We discussed several strategies for improving model performance:

Feature Engineering and Exploration
Assess the relevance of features, such as the 'gender' feature, and determine whether to keep or discard them based on domain knowledge, statistical tests, model-based feature importance, and ethical considerations.
Hyperparameter Tuning and Grid Search
Perform hyperparameter tuning using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to find optimal settings for each model.
Explore key hyperparameters for each algorithm, such as:
Number of neighbors for KNN
Maximum depth for the decision tree
Kernel and regularization parameter for SVM
Performance Metrics Adjustment
Choose the right performance metric that aligns with the business objectives and the nature of the data, considering metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC, and the confusion matrix.
Implementation
Python code examples were provided for training models, recording their performance, and plotting results. To further the analysis, detailed explanations on how to implement each improvement strategy were also discussed.

Conclusion
The process of comparing and improving classifiers involves careful analysis, iterative tuning, and validation against appropriate performance metrics. While the initial comparison gives us a baseline, fine-tuning and thoughtful feature engineering can lead to significant enhancements in model performance.
